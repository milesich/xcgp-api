[Input objects](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec-Input-Objects) can be described as "composable objects" because they include a set of input fields that define the object.

For more information, see "[About mutations](guides/graphql/using.md#about-mutations)".

## List of input objects

* [CreateUserInput](graphql/schema/createuserinput.md)
* [UpdateUserInput](graphql/schema/updateuserinput.md)
